We have used 2 datasets “survey_questions_meta” and “survey_responses” on which we have worked for the whole project. 
The project file(.ipynb format) “  ” initially contains the cleaning of the datasets and EDA . 
Coming to the modelling, we have used a Decision Tree classifier to classify the level of stress, which is the dependent column. This is predicted using career, nationality, gender, Department and many other responses to questions. 
Most of the data in our dataset is categorical and had string value which had to be converted to integer and create another dataset with the rectified values.
The code is read to use, hence there won’t be any modifications required to do from your end.
